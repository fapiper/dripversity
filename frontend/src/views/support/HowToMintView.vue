            <p class="text-lg">
                Minting refers to the process of creating an NFT and initially
                writing it to the blockchain. It establishes an immutable record
                of authenticity and ownership and represents the first ever
                interaction with a Dripversity NFT. Before minting, the item
                metadata is hidden. Upon creation on the blockchain, it is
                revealed and all of its unique traits and it's rarity are
                visible to the public. Minting your Dripversity NFT is really
                simple, youâ€™ll just need to do the following:

                <div>
                    <h2>1. Crypto Wallet</h2>

                    <p class="normal">
                        Ensure that you have access to a
                        <router-link
                            class="link"

                            >crypto wallet</router-link
                        >. It will hold your NFT's and cryptocurrency.
                        Dripversity NFT's are living on the Ethereum Blockchain,
                        so you will need an Ethereum compatible crypto wallet
                        like Metamask, Coinbase Wallet or Rainbow Wallet.

                        Ensure that you have adequate amounts of funds in your
                        crypto wallet. Dripversity's supported currency is ETH.
                        If you haven't got enough ETH in your wallet, you can
                        easily acquire some at a crypto exchange (the most
