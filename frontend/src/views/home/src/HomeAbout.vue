                To speak frankly, we were fed up with NFT collections displaying
                one human avatar with various shades of skin colors and calling
                it diverse. This ordinary NFT profile picture approach bored us
                and we wanted to include different ethnic backgrounds to display
                actual individual human characters.

                DRIPVERSITY uses a concept of five human characters that
                cherishes each individual's uniqueness while still being able to
                assign all wearable clothes, headwear pieces, and jewelry traits
                to every character.
